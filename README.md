# CS-255-Portfolio

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for this project was Liam, the owner of DriverPass. Liam wanted an online learning system where users could take online classes and practice tests to prepare for their drivers test. 

# What did you do particularly well?
For this project, I believe I did well in determining the needed requirements for the system based on the Interview with DriverPass. I transferred the objectives and goals of the project into functional and nonfunctional requirements in the business requirements document. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to choose one part of my work to revise, it would probably be the system design document. I feel that some of my diagrams could be revised to include more thorough detail of how the DriverPass system should function. It was not required to go into extra detail, but this is something I may pursue in the future for fun. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by using the business requirements document to create the system design document. Since the business requirements document lays out all the functional and nonfunctional requirements, I could create my UML diagrams based on the collected data. It is so important to consider the user’s needs when designing a system because a project that does not meet the needs of its users is an unsuccessful project that will not be useful for our clients.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I believe it is most important to first get user and client feedback before beginning any design process. I need to first determine what the project is and what the client needs it to perform. I will take notes during the interview process of requirements as well as any possible limitations. After the interview with the client, I will keep documentation updated throughout the development process.
